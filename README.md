# Analysis of the impact of different health-related habits on the academic results based on complex survey design

## The Final project for an econometric course in UCU Spring'20
This project dedicated to the analysis of the impact of different health-related habits on the academic results based on complex survey design.
As a dataset for the project [Young Risk Behavior Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) was chosen.

The main R package in the project to handle complex survey design structure is [survey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html).

Data loading and cleaning proceeded with R package [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html).

For visualization, we used the R package [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html).
Such types of visualization used:
* Histograms
* Stacked bar charts
* Scatter plots
* Line chart for time series

For hypothesis testing, we conducted t-tests and chi-squared tests.
Also, linear regressions were applied for modeling relations in visualizations. 

## For launching the project, unpack survey_data.rar to the project directory.
